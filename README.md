# machine-learning-I

Slides and lecture notes for the  course 'machine learning I' (first half) taught at the Graduate School Neural Information Processing in Tuebingen in the first half of the Winter-Semester 2012. The course is a half-semester, once weekly course for students studying for a Master's degree in Neural Information Processing at the University of Tuebingen. The course is supplemented by Machine Learning I (second half) taught by Prof. Bethge, and Machine Learning II taught by Profs. Giese and Endres. Please see the website of the graduate school Tuebingen for full details.

The course assumes some previous knowledge of linear algebra and probability theory, but includes a refresher to probability theory at the beginning. Being a short introductory course, it includes only very basic probabilistic algorithms for classification and regression.

Lecture notes were compiled by Patrick Putzky, patrick.putzky@googlemail.com.
